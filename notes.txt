lab03 -- BinarySearch vs LinearSearch
2021-12-22

DISCO:
- BinarySearch is significantly faster than LinearSearch. We can visualize this by graphing y=x and y=log_2(x). 
- Since BinarySearch is so efficient, we need to trial result so that result becomes significant. 
- The WORST case for both BinarySearch and LinearSearch is the target not being present in the array.
- There was a type in BinarySearch
- You can use "_" to make int literals for readable. (for eg 1_000_000)

QCC:
- Why do we need to use -XLint:unchecked?
- Is the way we implemented repeition of a trial valid and scientific?
- Is random target generating really the way to go?
- Why is our data printing so weirdly?
