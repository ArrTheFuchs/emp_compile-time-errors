lab03 -- BinarySearch vs LinearSearch
2021-12-20

DISCO:
- BinarySearch is significantly faster than LinearSearch. We can visualize this by graphing y=x and y=log_2(x). 
- Since BinarySearch is so efficient, we need to repeat a search in a trial until it becomes significant. 
- The WORST case for both BinarySearch and LinearSearch is the target not being present in the array.

QCC:
- Why do we need to use -XLint:unchecked?
- Is the way we implemented repeition of a trial valid and scientific?
- Is random target generating really the way to go?
