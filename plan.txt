**The** Plan:

Independent Variable: dataset size
Dependent Variable: time taken

Outline:

-Have 3 sets of tests, for data set of sizes 10, 100, 1000. (10 will 
be michael 100 will be salaj and 1000 will be ariel). 

-For each set of testing, we will do 10* trials. We will do this by using
2 nested for loops, one for each trial, one to generate the new data set
for each trial (each data set is an ordered array list filled with randomly
generated numbers)

-Each trial will have the following structure:

 //Generate Data set

 //Find start time for binary test

 //Do binary test

 //Find end time for binary test

 //Find start time for linear test

 //Do linear test

 //Find end time for linear test

 //find time difference for both and add it to an array that is composed
 //of data from each trial in a set

-Then we will find the average for each set for both binary and linear. 
And then analyze the results.
