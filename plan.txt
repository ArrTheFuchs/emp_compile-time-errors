**The** Plan:

Independent Variable: dataset size
Dependent Variable: time taken

Outline:

-Have 3 sets of tests, for data set of sizes 10, 1000, 10000. (10 will
be michael 1000 will be salaj and 10000 will be ariel).

-For each set of testing, we will do 10* trials. We will do this by using
2 nested for loops, one for each trial, one to generate the new data set
for each trial (each data set is filled with sequential numbers (1 tru size of data set)

-Each trial will have the following structure:

 //Generate Data set

 //Select number to be searched for

 //Find start time for binary test

 //Do binary test

 //Find end time for binary test

 //Find start time for linear test

 //Do linear test

 //Find end time for linear test

 //find time difference for both and add it to an array that is composed
 //of data from each trial in a set

-Then we will find the average for each set for both binary and linear.
And then analyze the results.
