**The** Plan:

Independent Variable: dataset size
Dependent Variable: time taken

Outline:

-Have 3 sets of tests, for data set of sizes 1,000,0000; 10,000,0000, 50,000,000. The dataSets will be named
mkamela, srijal and afuchs respectively. They will be populated with integers from 0 - sizeOfDataSet.

-For each data set we will conduct 10* trials. In each trial we will generate a random number from the data sets
that will become the target of the search. We will then measure the time it takes to do a binary search, and the time it takes
to do a linear search. We will then test worst case as well. There will be 2 double arrays for each data set that will contain the results of each trial.
The only controllable enviormental variables that should vary are the search algorithms themselves.

-After the testing we will display the results of our experiment.

Structure:

1. create mkamela dataset
2. create 2 double arrays of size 10 which will contain the results of each trial, and one Integer array that will contain the target
3. create a for-loop that runs 10 times. Inside the for-loop we:
    a. generate target and add to targetArray
    b. conduct linear search and add time taken to linData
    c. conduct binary search and add time taken to binData
4. test worst case for array

4. repeat steps 1-3, but for the other datasets (srijal and afuchs)
6. print out our data (result of each trial and average)
